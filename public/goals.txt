// From scratch, initialize the React app ✔️
// Render an <App /> component ✔️
// Create the <App /> component from scratch ✔️
// Have the <App /> component render 3 or 4 checkboxes with 
//paragraphs or spans next to it✔️
// like you're making a todo list with some hard-coded items 
//on it✔️

1. Change the input/p combo below to be a new component called <TodoItem />. <TodoItem /> (for now) will just have the same displayed data below (every todo item is the same) hardcoded inside of it. (We'll learn soon how to make the TodoItem more flexible)

PT3.✔️
Challenge: Using the array map method, render a child component for each todo item in the todosData array and pass the relevant data to it.

PT4.✔️
Convert to Class based componenet 

PT5. ✔️
Convert to stateful class componenet that pulls data and displays correctly. 

PT6. 
 1. Create an event handler in the App component for when the checkbox is clicked (which is an `onChange` event)
    a. This method will be the trickiest part. Check the comments in the stubbed-out method below for some pseudocode to help guide you through this part
  2. Pass the method down to the TodoItem component
  3. In the TodoItem component, make it so when the `onChange` event happens, it calls the `handleChange` method and passes the id of the todo into the function
